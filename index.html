  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a recent graduate from Kennesaw State University with a Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. My experiences have provided a strong foundation in system design, software testing, application development, and process optimization.</p>
  
  <p>I gained professional experience through the Disney College Program at Walt Disney World Resort, where I work as a Park Greeter, delivering exceptional Guest service, solving operational challenges, and supporting daily park operations. I also completed a software engineering internship at Northrop Grumman, where I developed automation tools, performed testing, and created software solutions to streamline engineering processes while maintaining a <strong>secret level security clearance</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>Through these experiences, I have honed my leadership, problem-solving, and analytical skills, and I am passionate about project management and coordinating teams to achieve impactful results. I am eager to apply my skills and passion to innovative projects that enhance operations, efficiency, and the user or Guest experience.</p>
